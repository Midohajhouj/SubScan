If you'd like to contribute code or bug fixes, please fork the repository to your own GitHub account and clone it to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Midohajhouj/SubScan.git

2. Create a New Branch

Before you make any changes, create a new branch for your work. This keeps your contributions separate from the main codebase, and allows us to easily review them.

git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

3. Make Your Changes

Make the changes you'd like to contribute. Be sure to follow the project's coding style and conventions. If you're working on a bug fix, please include a description of the issue in the commit message.

    If you’re fixing a bug, describe how the bug was resolved.
    If you’re adding a feature, describe what it does and how it enhances the project.

4. Run Tests

Before you submit your pull request, ensure that all tests pass and everything works correctly. You can run the tests locally, if applicable.
